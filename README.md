# Edify


This a website that allows tutors and students to create accounts and communicate.
Students can filter tutors based on courses they want to learn and book appointments with them.


Steps for starting up service:
1. Go to \edify-server and type "nodemon" to run node.js server on localhost:3000.
2. Go to \edify and type "npm start" to run the react.js app on localhost:3001.
3. The MongoDB server should be connected too. (See report for DB schema).
